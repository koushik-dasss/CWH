<!-- Basics(HTML,CSS,JS) of Web Development by CWH

How a website works ?	
What is HTML,CSS and JS?

HTML = Hyper Text Markup Language
CSS = Cascading Style Sheets
JS = JavaScript

Basic requirements to build a website

HTML(Must required to make a website)
It's the body.

CSS(beauty)
JS(brain)

Example- Car 
(First a metallic body is required = HTML works like this )(body)

Designing work of the car ,colour, decors = CSS works like this (beauty) 

Brain of car is Engine = JS works like this in a website, like a brain of the website.


HOW A WEBSITE WORKS?

           (Client requests for the website)
Web Server ---------------Client  
                        (In windows,Ubuntu,Debian systems etc.)                   
-->
                           
<!-- Web Server     ----------- Client   
 (Server resturns the response)
(Server returns the response using HTML ,CSS , JS)

Web Server(IP Adress) has a backend server, made up of Php,Python,NodeJS etc.

Every server has it's own backend server and IP address.

Backend does some processing and computations , which results in HTML,CSS and JS.

A website can have several different web pages inside it , which will be served according to the requests of the client . 

The main or actual website from which it is requested , is known as the "Domain" of the website . 

If not available , it will give a 404 error .

HTML is the body , which consists of CSS and JS within it.


Client does requests to a website.
Simply put, a domain name (or just "domain") is the name of a website. It's what comes after "@" in an email address, or after "www." in a web address. If someone asks how to find you online, what you tell them is usually your domain name.

404 error = Not available (If the request's answer isn't avaialble)

A 404 error is when a website's server can't find the page you're trying to access via a hyperlink or typing a URL in your browser. In these cases, any link to a page that isn't there, or a link with a typo in the target URL is called a dead or broken link.

Web Browser manipulates the code done in backend  and shows the front end of the website, as per the request of the client.(Processes the HTML,CSS,JS to show up the website)
