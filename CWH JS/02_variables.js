console.log("This is the first line in the code that is going to be printed");
// var a = 67;
// don't use var , use let or const
let a = 67; // 67 is a literal here
console.log(a); // number 
a = "Koushik"; // changed data type at runtime as it's a dynamically typed language 
console.log(a); // string
// remember rules for variable declaration 
// js is case sensiitve but it affects readability
